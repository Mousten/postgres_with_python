# postgres_with_python
 Working with postgres databases using Python's psycopg2 module.

The general idea is to understand how we would go about connecting to a previously created empty database via psql 
or pgAdmin whichever you prefer. This is assuming that we 
have both/either PostgreSQL or pgAdmin installed in our system.

If not and you have adequate knowledge of Docker, you can use the attached docker compose yaml file to start a container with both.

In this case we undertake to connect to an empty sales database, create tables, insert data into them and update them as well.

Later, we'll add SQL files where we get to create Views, Functions, Stored Procedures & see how we can call these from
Python.

Enjoy!

PS: You can propose changes/improvements, it's work in progress.
